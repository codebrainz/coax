# Coax

Coax is a simple plain C utility library that contains code I often use in
projects over and over. It is inspired by Glib but has only a small subset of
similar utilities.

You can either link the Coax library into your project, embed the library
sources directly into your own code, or generate single header file that you
can include into your project similar to STB-libraries.

The project is currently under development and not meant for production use.
